# Interpreting-Bit-Patterns
A C++ program that interprets 10-bit patterns as unsigned magnitude, signed magnitude, One's Complement, and Two's Complement.

## Examples

### When 1010101010 is used as input, program outputs:

Binary: 1010101010  
Unsigned Decimal: 682  
Signed Decimal: -170  
One's Complement: -341  
Two's Complement: -342

### When 0101010101 is used as input, program outputs:  

Binary: 0101010101  
Unsigned Decimal: 341  
Signed Decimal: +341  
One's Complement: +341  
Two's Complement: +341
